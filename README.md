Linked List
===========

For homework finish up the exercise from class. Specifically you'll
need to answer questions (3) and (5).

Your code goes in the `list.rb` file and you can run that code with

```sh
ruby list.rb
```

Hint: The method you write for determining the length can/should
follow the same pattern we used for `add_to_tail` and `to_s`. That
pattern also follows the recusive patterns we discussed in class: You
do one thing if `@next` is `nil` and something else when it's not.
